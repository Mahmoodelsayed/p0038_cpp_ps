# ps0006 - Special Counter

## Required
- To make for me a special decimal-based counter using function which I can pass it some parameters like end, start (default = `0`) & step (default = `1`) increasing or decreasing.
- Take in consideration all bugs & errors, try to fix as much as you can of them and exit the program outputting a clear error message.
- there is no test cases for that time. Feel free to chat with me as a client on [Whatsapp](https://wa.me/201553566100) or [Facebook Messanger](https://www.facebook.com/61560263336743/) if you want to ask me more about my requirements.
